# Intro

Welcome fellow Ape üëã

Enjoy apeing into NFTs and wonder how good of a JPEG flippoor you really are?

Say no more. NFTüçåAPE will answer that for you. It will scan your wallet's transaction history and tell you exactly:

- how much you've spent on NFTs
- how much you've earned from NFTs
- your Profit/Loss
- how much you've [paperhanded](https://mywallst.com/blog/what-does-paper-hands-mean/)**
- how much you're [diamondhanding](https://mywallst.com/blog/what-does-diamond-hands-mean/)***

** example: you sold your SMB at 30 SOL, thinking you've made a killer flip. It's now worth 500 SOL. You've "paperhanded" 470 SOL.

*** example: you bought a Boryoku Dragon at 10 SOL on one of the marketplaces. You're still holding it, and it's currently worth 1500 SOL. You're "diamondhanding" a total of 1500 SOL.

Once done, you can share with your fellow Apesüçå on Twitter with 1 click! üöÄ

# Is it free?
- 100% free
- 100% open source
- No need to connect your wallet (no security concerns), simply paste your address

# How does it work?
TLDR:
1. It fetches all transactions that mention your wallet's address and looks for those involving marketplaces. This gives us historic sales
2. It fetches all current tokens in your wallet and filters for NFTs
3. It fetches NFT metadata, prices, and other stuff to be able to calculate the stats you care about

Limitations
- Doesn't look beyond 1 wallet
- Doesn't know what other wallets belong to you, and hence doesn't try to aggregate across them
- Doesn't index NFT transactions if they're not going to / coming from one of the supported marketplace (below). This means:
    - If you sold your NFT OTC, it won't register
    - If you sold your NFT somewhere besides the 6 marketplaces, it won't register
    - If you sent your NFT to a different wallet, then sold it, it won't register 
    - More generally, if you sent your NFT to a different wallet, it will think you still own it (since it has no idea why/whom you sent it to)
- Currently Solana only
- Currently 6 marketplaces only (MagicEden, SolanArt, DigitalEyes, Alpha Art, Exchange.Art, SolSea)
- Currently, if you bought / sold the same NFT (same mint) multiple times, only the last sale will be accounted for
- Because NFTs are by definition non-fungible, to be able to calculate paper/diamond-hands amount it needs to choose a proxy for your NFT's current price. The app let's you choose between floor / median / mean prices - but ultimately they're all proxies. Your specific NFT might have a different value.
- New collections need to be added manually (see below). It's not a lot of work - 1-2min per collection, but it's work:)
- Certain NFTs are excluded, if they don't follow the modern Metaplex standard (eg if they don't have at least a single Creator listed)

# (!) IMPORTANT - Adding NFT Collections
Unfortunately new collections need to be added manually to the app. This is because each marketplace uses a different "slug" to represent the collection, and I couldn't think of a programmatic way of getting those.

Steps to follow:
1. Go to [this file](https://github.com/ilmoi/nftape.me/blob/main/src/common/marketplaces/mpCollections.ts)
2. Add desired to collection to `collections` following this format:
```js
  "first creator address goes here": {
    SA: 'solanart slug goes here',
    DE: 'digitaleyes slug goes here',
    ME: 'magic eden slug goes here',
  },
```
3. Please run `yarn test`. There's only one test, and it checks to make sure you didn't make a typo. It does that by actually trying to fetch the data from marketplaces, and making sure no request times out.

Where do you get the first creator's address?
- Get your token's mint and open it in explorer, eg [Degen Ape 9161](https://explorer.solana.com/address/GUFMMLQ2tAaf4aLgzSvFQLvQhKD2jY22XmGZuPLEwvM3)
- Click on "creators", then copy the FIRST address (has to be the FIRST!)

Now where do you get those slugs? They're hidden inside URLs. Eg for degen apes:
- [Solanart url](https://solanart.io/collections/degenape). Slug = `degenape`
- [Digitaleyes url](https://digitaleyes.market/collections/Degenerate%20Ape%20Academy). Slug = `Degenerate%20Ape%20Academy`
- [Magiceden url](https://magiceden.io/marketplace/degenerate_ape_academy). Slug = `degenerate_ape_academy`

Once you paste all of the above, you should get this (for Degen Apes):
```js
  '9BKWqDHfHZh9j39xakYVMdr6hXmCLHH5VfCpeq2idU9L': {
    SA: 'degenape',
    DE: 'Degenerate%20Ape%20Academy',
    ME: 'degenerate_ape_academy',
  },
```

A few notes:
- not all marketplaces have all collections. That's ok. As long at least 1 marketplace has it - we'll be able to pull prices and calculate paper/diamond-hands.
- currently we're only pulling prices from those 3 marketplace - MagicEden, Solanart, Digital Eyes (yes this is different to the 6 marketplaces for which we're monitoring transactions).
- CAPITALIZATION MATTERS. Copy as is from the browser.

Submit a PR if you want a collection added, I'll try to accept them promptly.
