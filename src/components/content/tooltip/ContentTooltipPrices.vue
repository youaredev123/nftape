    <p>To calculate the amount you've paperhanded we need to compare the price you sold your NFT at with the current price.</p>
    <p class="mt-5">But what is the current price? NFTs are... well.. non-fungible. This means there really isn't a "current price" for your exact NFT, unless someone sold it in the last 15 min.</p>
    <p class="mt-5">This leaves us with a choice: we can compare your sales price to one of the following:</p>
    <p class="mt-5">1. The current floor price</p>
    <p>2. The current mean</p>
    <p>3. The current median</p>
    <p class="mt-5">There isn't a right or wrong answer here, just a matter of preference. You can use the dropdown on the right to express yours:)</p>
